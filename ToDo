# = Larger Step
- = smaller sub-step

# Make it so the rubies bounce off of one another
- Reuse collision detection code for mouse but reverse both directions instead
- use array of rubies and loop through it
-- Do I have to check every other ruby for each individual ruby?
--- just do it at first and can look for a faster solution later if necessary

# Shoot confetti when hammer collides (see flappy bird tutorial)
- make it red so it's like the ruby shattered
# play a sound that sounds like the ruby has been smashed with a hammer

#Ruby accelerates constantly
#Ruby slows down after colliding with a wall then begins accelerating again

#Convert RubyIcon into just a game_object class (holds all data about each object spawned)
and move the definitions for RubyIcon into a config file instead.

# Turn the hammer into a penis and the ruby into a vagina
# Make a spooge/cumming sound when you hit a vagina with the penis
# Every time you hit a vagina with a penis 5 times, you hear your mother and god yelling at you
# implement different levels of difficulty
# roll it into a gamestate object for all the main parameters of the game
