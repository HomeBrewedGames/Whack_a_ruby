# = Larger Step
- = smaller sub-step

# score in text at top left of screen
# Shoot confetti when they collide (see flappy bird tutorial)
- make it red so it's like the ruby shattered
# play a sound that sounds like the ruby has been smashed with a hammer



#Ruby accelerates constantly
#Ruby slows down after colliding with a wall then begins accelerating again

#Convert RubyIcon into just a game_object class (holds all data about each object spawned)
and move the definitions for RubyIcon into a config file instead.

# Turn the hammer into a penis and the ruby into a vagina
# Make a spooge/cumming sound when you hit a vagina with the penis
# Every time you hit a vagina with a penis 5 times, you hear your mother and god yelling at you
# score in the top left corner with the words "number of vaginas fucked"
# bullshit meter in the top left corner with the words "amount of bullshit you've had to put up with so far"

# Make an entire suite of games based around the topic of how much bullshit will you tolerate before you
decide to just stop giving a fuck. becoming more aware of it.
Make the games as annoying as possible to get the point across.

#Randomly generated RPG. Like the board is all random wherever you go. And you meet people who give you random quests
in the game and the quests mimic like undoing realizations as you watch the character doing it. and it also gives
real-world missions too.
